Here's a project idea:

*Project:* Effect of Different Optimizers on Classification Performance

*Objective:* Investigate the effect of different optimizers on the performance of a neural network classifier on the MNIST dataset.

*Optimizers:*

1. *Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)*
2. *Adam*
3. *RMSprop*
4. *Adagrad*
5. *Nadam*

*Experiment Design:*

1. *Model Architecture:* Use a simple neural network architecture with one hidden layer.
2. *Training:* Train the model on the MNIST dataset using each optimizer.
3. *Evaluation:* Evaluate the performance of each optimizer using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. *Comparison:* Compare the performance of each optimizer and determine which one achieves the best results.

*Code:*

You can use the following Python code using Keras and TensorFlow to implement this project:
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import SGD, Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad, Nadam
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load MNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Preprocess data
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 784) / 255.0
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 784) / 255.0

# Define model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(256, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

# Define optimizers
optimizers = {
    'SGD': SGD(),
    'Adam': Adam(),
    'RMSprop': RMSprop(),
    'Adagrad': Adagrad(),
    'Nadam': Nadam()
}

# Train and evaluate model for each optimizer
results = {}
for name, optimizer in optimizers.items():
    model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=128, verbose=0)
    y_pred = model.predict(x_test)
    y_pred_class = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)
    results[name] = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_class)

# Print results
for name, accuracy in results.items():
    print(f'{name}: {accuracy:.3f}')
This code trains and evaluates a neural network classifier on the MNIST dataset using each optimizer and prints the accuracy of each optimizer.

*Results:*

The results will show the performance of each optimizer on the MNIST dataset. You can compare the accuracy of each optimizer to determine which one performs best.

*Discussion:*

The results of this project can provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different optimizers for classification tasks. You can discuss the implications of your findings and how they can be applied to real-world problems.
